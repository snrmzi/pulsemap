# PulseMap Development Report

This document tracks all the changes I made to the PulseMap project during development.

## Project Overview

PulseMap is a real-time natural disaster monitoring web app that gives live updates on earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, wildfires, floods and solar flares from various public APIs.

**Tech Stack**: Node.js + Express + SQLite + Leaflet.js + Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Development Changelog

### 2025-06-29 - Initial Project Setup

**Time**: Project initiation
**Developer**: San

#### âœ… Project Infrastructure
- Set up Node.js project with npm
- Got Express.js web server running
- Configured SQLite database with proper schema
- Built RESTful API structure with separate route files
- Implemented session-based authentication system
- Added bcryptjs for password hashing

#### âœ… Database Schema
Created SQLite tables:
- `events`: Stores natural disaster events (id, event_id, type, title, description, magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, location, time, url, created_at)
- `admin_users`: Stores admin credentials (id, username, password_hash, created_at)
- Default admin user created (username: admin, password: admin123)

#### âœ… Backend API Development
- **GET /api/events**: Get all events with optional type filtering
- **GET /api/events/recent**: Get latest 20 events for sidebar
- **GET /api/events/:id**: Get specific event details
- **GET /api/stats**: Get event statistics by type
- **POST /admin/login**: Admin authentication
- **POST /admin/logout**: Admin session termination
- **GET /admin/events**: Admin event management (protected)
- **PUT /admin/events/:id**: Update event details (protected)
- **DELETE /admin/events/:id**: Delete events (protected)
- **POST /admin/cleanup**: Manual data cleanup (protected)

#### âœ… Frontend Development
- **Main Application** (`index.html`):
  - Dark-themed responsive design
  - Leaflet.js integration for interactive world map
  - Real-time event display with custom markers
  - Event filtering by disaster type
  - Sidebar with recent events and statistics
  - Modal popup for detailed event information

- **Admin Dashboard** (`admin.html`):
  - Secure admin interface
  - Event management table with edit/delete functionality
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Manual data cleanup feature
  - Session management

- **Admin Login** (`login.html`):
  - Clean login interface
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Automatic redirection after successful login

#### âœ… Styling and UX
- Modern dark theme with orange accent colors (#ff6b35)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Custom event markers with different colors and shapes per disaster type
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Professional typography and spacing

#### âœ… Data Integration
- USGS Earthquake API integration
- Auto data fetching every 10 minutes using node-cron
- Data processing and storage in SQLite
- Duplicate prevention using unique event IDs
- 7-day data retention with auto cleanup

#### âœ… Security Implementation
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (salt rounds: 10)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Protected admin routes with middleware
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention

#### âœ… Deployment Configuration
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for production deployment
- **fly.toml**: Fly.io deployment configuration
- **Environment**: Production-ready environment variables
- **Git**: Proper .gitignore for Node.js projects

#### âœ… Documentation
