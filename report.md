# PulseMap Development Report

This document tracks all the changes I made to the PulseMap project during development.

## Project Overview

PulseMap is a real-time natural disaster monitoring web app that gives live updates on earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, wildfires, floods and solar flares from various public APIs.

**Tech Stack**: Node.js + Express + SQLite + Leaflet.js + Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

#### âœ… Project Infrastructure
- Set up Node.js project with npm
- Got Express.js web server running
- Configured SQLite database with proper schema
- Built RESTful API structure with separate route files
- Implemented session-based authentication system
- Added bcryptjs for password hashing

#### âœ… Database Schema
Created SQLite tables:
- `events`: Stores natural disaster events (id, event_id, type, title, description, magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, location, time, url, created_at)
- `admin_users`: Stores admin credentials (id, username, password_hash, created_at)
- Default admin user created (username: admin, password: admin123)

#### âœ… Backend API Development
- **GET /api/events**: Get all events with optional type filtering
- **GET /api/events/recent**: Get latest 20 events for sidebar
- **GET /api/events/:id**: Get specific event details
- **GET /api/stats**: Get event statistics by type
- **POST /admin/login**: Admin authentication
- **POST /admin/logout**: Admin session termination
- **GET /admin/events**: Admin event management (protected)
- **PUT /admin/events/:id**: Update event details (protected)
- **DELETE /admin/events/:id**: Delete events (protected)
- **POST /admin/cleanup**: Manual data cleanup (protected)

#### âœ… Frontend Development

#### âœ… Security Implementation
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (salt rounds: 10)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Protected admin routes with middleware
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention

#### âœ… Deployment Configuration

### 2025-06-29 - Tsunami Support Added

**Time**: Feature enhancement
**Developer**: San

#### âœ… Tsunami Data Integration
- **NOAA Tsunami API**: Integrated active tsunami warnings, watches, and advisories
- **Threat Level System**: Uses magnitude field to store threat levels (1=Advisory, 2=Watch, 3=Warning)
- **Geographic Coverage**: Shows affected regions with transparent circles around source points
- **Real-time Updates**: Fetches data every 10 minutes alongside earthquake data

#### âœ… Frontend Enhancements
- **Custom Tsunami Markers**: Blue markers with transparent affected area circles
- **Threat Level Display**: Color-coded threat levels in popups and modals
- **Affected Area Visualization**: Radius varies by threat level (100-200km)
- **Enhanced Modal Details**: Shows threat level instead of magnitude for tsunamis

#### âœ… Data Processing
- **API Integration**: NOAA Weather Service alerts API for active tsunami events
- **Coordinate Handling**: Supports various geometry types (Point, Polygon, MultiPolygon)
- **Unique Event IDs**: Prevents duplicate tsunami alerts using combined ID and onset time
- **Metadata Storage**: Stores description, affected areas, and official alert URLs

#### ðŸŽ¯ Technical Implementation
- **Server-side**: Added `fetchTsunamiData()` function with error handling
- **Database**: Reused existing events table structure with magnitude as threat level
- **Frontend**: Enhanced marker creation with transparent circles for affected areas
- **Styling**: Color-coded threat levels (Yellow=Advisory, Orange=Watch, Red=Warning)
